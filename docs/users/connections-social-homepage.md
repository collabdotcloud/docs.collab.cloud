# HCL Connections Social Homepage

For Connections 7, the Social Homepage (also known as orient-me) is set as the default landing page.

The previous activity stream based homepage can be activated with the homepage switcher:

## Caveats

The setting is stored in the browser. If you have to clear the browser cache, the switch needs to be re-applied. If you use multiple browsers, you need to set it per browser.

The social homepage can't be set as the default homepage for your environment at the moment.
