#Activities Plus Tips and Tricks

Welcome to Activities Plus! The new enhanced way of working with your Activities. Activities Plus will increase your productivity and give you a better overview of your tasks, your team's tasks, status of a project, follow-ups, and more!

Find, or start working with Activities in Activities Plus by clicking:

**_Apps â€“ Activities Plus_** in the Menu Bar

You will now see the start page of Activities Plus where you will find all your Activities. The picture below shows a start page with colourful tiles. Each tile is one Activity with names (blurred in this image), when it was last accessed, progress on tasks etc.

###On this start page you can:

* Create a new Activity by clicking on the **_Plus sign and Create_**

* Open an existing Activity by clicking on one of the tiles

* Search for an Activity by entering the search word in the **_Search Boards_** field at the top

* Filter Activities by **_My_**, **_Public_** and **_Archive_**

* Sort Activities by **_Recent_** and **_Last accessed_**

* Add colour labels to the Activities for easy sorting and filtering. Click on **_Colours_** to name them, drag and drop them up on an Activity tile. After that, filter by clicking on one of the colours.

* Add tags to the Activities for easy sorting and filtering in the same way as with colours above.

* See all your collected tasks from all your Activities/Boards by clicking on **_Todos_**

* Find the template library by clicking on **_Templates_**


##Accessing and working with an existing Activity

Open an existing Activity by clicking on one of the Activity tiles.

<img src="/assets/images/screen-shots/aplus/aplus-activity.png" alt="Activity" />

All tasks in this Activity are shown in this view. Each title row is a **_List_** and and underneath the lists you find the **_tasks_**. Expand or collapse the lists by clicking the arrows on the list row or **_Expand All_** / **_Collapse All_**.

Both Lists and Tasks can be moved around up and down by drag and drop. A task can also be moved from one list to another by drag and drop.
