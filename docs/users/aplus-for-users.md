#Where Are the Activities?

Your existing Activities are migrated to Activities Plus. When you create a new Activity, it will be created in Activities Plus. The previous, older version of HCL Connections Activities is not available in our Connections Cloud any longer.

An Activity can be a **stand alone Activity** or a **Community Activity**.

##Stand Alone Activity

A stand alone Activity can be private for personal work and task management, or shared for collaborative work with colleagues in your organisation.

To access and work with a stand alone Activity, go to:

**_Apps â€“ Activities Plus_** in the Menu Bar
