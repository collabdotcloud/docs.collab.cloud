#Activities Plus Tips and Tricks

Welcome to Activities Plus! The new enhanced way of working with your activities. Activities Plus will increase your productivity and give you a better overview of your tasks, your team's tasks, status of a project, follow-ups, and more!

Activities can be private for personal work and task management, or shared for collaborative work with colleagues in your organisation.

##Where Are the Activities?

Your existing activities are moved to Activities Plus. The previous, older version of HCL Connections Activities is not available in Connections Cloud any longer. When you create a new activity, it will be created in Activities Plus.

Find your activities in Activities Plus by clicking:

**_Apps – Activities Plus_** in the Menu Bar

An activity can be a **stand alone Activity** or connected to a Connections Community, a **Community Activity**.

Both a stand alone Activity and a Community Activity can be found by clicking **_Apps – Activities Plus_** in the Menu Bar. Community Activities can also be found in the Connections Community they are added to.

## Stand Alone Activity

To access and work with a stand alone Activity, go to the Activities Plus page by clicking **_Apps – Activities Plus_** in the Menu Bar.

Here you can work with your existing Activities, or create new ones.

## Community Activity

A Community Activity is an Activity that has been added to a specific HCL Connections Community. The members of the Community are also members of the Community Activity. Collaborate and access the Activity directly in the Community.

If you cannot see any Activities in a Community, the Activities Plus widget needs to be added to the Community. The Community Manager has access rights to do that.
