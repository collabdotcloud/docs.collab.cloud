#Using the Support portal

Welcome to our new Support Portal!

In order to help our customers in an efficient and fast way, we have started working in a support portal which all organisations in the ThreeThirds environment has access to. The goal is to make it easy for you to log issues with us, to get clearer updates, and ultimately to present solutions to you in a better way.

## All organisations have access to the Support Portal

All Organisation Admins have access to this portal and your account has been created already. You log in with the same username and password as for the ThreeThirds environment. If you log in with SSO you will have to click the "Forgot Password" button on the login page, and you will receive an email with instructions.

If you experience a problem with any of our services, and want to open a support case, please go to

[support.collab.cloud](https://support.collab.cloud)

The startpage of the Support Portal lets you start a new case or see ongoing cases.

## Open a request - log an issue

Start a new request by clicking **_New Request_** in the left side menu.

Choose which product you want to log an issue with in the menu that opens.

Fill in the form as detailed as possible. It is very important that we receive as much information as you have, so please include anything you can think of that will help us in the case. Otherwise we might need to come back to you with requests for more information and that will pro long the process on getting the issue solved.

Information that helps us is for example:

- which user experience the issue
- do you have any screenshots that can help describe the issue
- when does the issue occur

Screenshots can be pasted in the description field together with the text. Copy/Paste works great. Other files can be uploaded under **_Attachments_**.

You can also add another contact under **_Contacts_** if you want another person to receive updates in this matter. This person needs to be another Org Admin.
