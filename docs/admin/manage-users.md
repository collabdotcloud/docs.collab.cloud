### Controlling user access.

To disable access to all collab.cloud services you may make a user Inactive when editing their details, this will remove them from all relevant groups and block access to logging in, it does not however remove any subscriptions from the user, if you wish to recover and reuse any connections subscriptions, you may also remove those by clicking the `x` on each subscription.

You may also update an "Inactive" user by setting them to "Active", this will reinstate any relevant groups and access as required.
