# Managing Your Organisation

## Logging into the Administration Console
Administrators can log into the *ThreeThirds Collaboration Admin* interface by using your organization's assigned link relevant to your datacenter.

You need to be assigned the *Admin* role, and you need your ThreeThirds username and password to access console.
