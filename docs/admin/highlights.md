#Configure

When you create a new Community, Highlights is configured by default and will be the default landing page for your community, it will contain all widgets of the default applications for a new community. You can then add applications to your community and then the highlihts widget or pick widgets that are unrelated to a community feature.
As you can see in the image, the newly created community contains Blogs, Wikis and Rich Content by default and the Highlights app is added as well, the widgets on the highlights app by default on new community creation are: Blog, Members, Community Description, Wiki, Rich Content and Tag Cloud.
