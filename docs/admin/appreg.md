# Connections Application Register (AppReg)

Organizaton Administrators can add custom Extensions via our admin portal [EU](https://admineu.collab.cloud)/ [NA](https://adminna.collab.cloud) or directly through the Applications Register at `https://yourtenantname.collab.cloud/appreg`.

There's no automatic way to upload the additional files - JavaScript and/or CSS - for your extension. Please create a ticket for that.
