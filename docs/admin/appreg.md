# Connections Application Register (AppReg)

Organizaton Administrators can add custom Extensions via the Applications Register at `https://yourtenantname.collab.cloud/appreg`

There's no automatic way to upload the additional files - JavaScript and/or CSS - for your extension. Please create a ticket for that.
