The following is for Administrators to consider: You will need to register your new user in the Domino Directory, and set a password for the Notes ID if your user is to use Notes client. Notes ID/Internet passwords are not used to authenticate to Connections/Verse mail via browser and/or apps, plugins or other. If you are registering an on-premise Mail or Apps user - this user is completely independent of the collab.cloud environment and this procedure does not apply. Register user in Domino Directory \u00b6 Register the user as per your normal process, ensure that your nominated collab.cloud mail servers have been specified, and that the correct Policy is applied. Directory Sync \u00b6 Your Mail cluster is configured to synchronize your Domino Directory with the collab.cloud identity management system and the Admin App approximately every 4 hours ** The Directory Sync process will detect changes in the Domino Directory and perform the following: Add any new users registered in the Domino Directory to collab.cloud and will be visible in the Admin App Assign a Clustered Mail Cloud license to any new users who are registered against your nominated collab.cloud Mail Servers and mailboxes created Assign a Clustered Mail Cloud license to any existing users who have been moved/updated to collab.cloud Mail Servers and mailboxes transferred via Domino (adminP) process Assign a Clustered Mail Cloud license to any existing Connections users in collab.cloud who have been registered in the Domino Directory for mail Remove all licenses from any users who have been deleted from the Domino Directory and set the user status to Inactive ** The 4-hour sync process is temporary while migrations from IBM Connections Cloud are being completed and the User management processes are being finalised. After the sync process has created/updated the user in the Admin App - you can then set a password and (if required) assign a Connections license. You may also notice that the Shortname/UserID field in the Person Document is updated with a unique number or univeral ID value. For users migrated from IBM Cloud it may be a value like 200112345 For new users it may be a value like 60474dad-d943-404c-8e1a-fb096bc54716 This is the assigned UID from the collab.cloud identity system and is critical for Connections/Mail/IM integration and authentication. Please do not remove this value (as it will just reappear next sync and break functionality in the meantime). Set/Reset user password \u00b6 Clicking the reset password button gives you 2 options as follows Clicking \"Send reset email\" sends a link to the user at their specified email address that they can click on to set their password. Clicking \"Set password\" allows you to set a temporary password for the user. They will need to change this as soon as they login. NOTE: For new Mail users - using the \"Set password\" function is required as the user will not be able to retrieve the password email if they have never logged in. Updating user info \u00b6 Name changes performed via the Domino (adminP) process will be synchronized with the collab.cloud Admin App - however email addresses are not changed automatically . Please send a request to support@collab.cloud for email address changes for Clustered Mail Cloud users. Deleting Users from Domino Directory \u00b6 When a user is deleted from the Domino directory.
